  <h3>Fashion-VDM: Video Diffusion Model for Virtual Try-On, SIGGRAPH Asia 2024</h3>
  <p><i><b>Johanna Karras</b>, Yingwei Li, Nan Liu, Luyang Zhu, Innfarn Yoo, Andreas Lugmayr, Chris Lee, Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman</i></p>
  Given a garment image and person video, Fashion-VDM synthesizes a photorealistic try-on video. We introduce a state-of-the-art video virtual try-on model based on diffusion, split classifier-free guidance, joint image-video training for try-on, and a progressive temporal training scheme.

  <h3>Perturb-and-Revise: Flexible 3D Editing with Generative Trajectories, CVPR 2025</h3>
  <p><i>Susung Hong, <b>Johanna Karras</b>, Ricardo Martin-Brualla, Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman</i></p>
  <p>We propose Perturb-and-Revise, which makes possible a variety of NeRF editing. First, we perturb the NeRF parameters with random initializations to create a versatile initialization. Then, we revise the edited NeRF via generative trajectories.</p>

  <p>Given a person image and pose sequence, DreamPose generates an animation of the input person following the pose sequence. DreamPose equips Stable Diffusion with pose-and-image guidance, using a novel encoder architecture and finetuning strategy.</p>

#### Deep Neural Networks for Black Hole Imaging

* As an undergraduate at Caltech, I worked in with Professor Katie Bouman and Dr. He Sun on deep neural network techniques for black hole imaging. The project was presented at CVPR 2021. See the project and extended abstract in the [Github Repo](https://github.com/johannakarras/Deep-Neural-Networks-for-Black-Hole-Imaging).
